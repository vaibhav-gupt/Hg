# 1d6 Flyerbook
You want to play, but you have no adventure at hand? You only have 2 hours so you don’t want to spend 2 hours learning rules and creating charakters?  
Then this Flyerbook is for you.
It contains short rules, a base scenario for the game master and pregenerated charactercards. On additional flyers there are further scenarios for longer sessions.
The Flyerbook is an instant-RPG for Cons and short sessions and targets an experienced GM and 2-5 players - from beginners to veterans. Charactercards and scenrarios are available at flyer.1w6.org (Free PDF’s).
## Plan 
The GM reads this rule-sheet and the base scenario. Meanwhile every player chooses a character card and reads the rules. If you have new players, the experienced players tell them how cool roleplaying is and how it works.  
Then the players hand the GM the additional scenarios they want to play. The GM reads the scenarios while the players organize one die (D6) for each participant.
## Rules 
As ruleset the flyerbooks use the free 1d6-system. The characters have attributes, jobs, skills, edges and flaws which differenciate them from the masses. Jobs and skills have numbers  (6-18). Attributes, edges and flaws only have plusses (Strength) oder Minusses (Weakness).  
*Examples: Agility, Intelligence and Pride are Attributes. Carpenter is a job and hand-to-hand combat is a skill. Wealthy (+) is an edge and addicted (-) a flaw.*
###  Task
If you want to know, if a character masters a hard task, you can roll a die. First you check if he has a fitting job or skill (when there are multiple, take the highest). If yes, start with its value. If not, use the fallback 3.  
Then check his attributes: If he uses a skill, he gets a bonus of 1 per + in each attribute which fits the task. If he uses a job or the fallback 3, he only gets the bonus from the highest fitting attribute. If others support him with fitting skills, he gets an additional point bonus per supporter.  
Now roll a D6 (six sided die). If the die shows an even number, add it to your value. If the number is uneven, substract it (this is called ±D6). If the result reaches the difficulty of the task, the character masters the task (6 is routine, 9 easy, 12 challenging, 15 hard). The difference between your result and the difficulty shows how well you master the task.  
*Example: Harrak wants to pick the lock of the trapdoor below the bar. He’s a seasoned thief (Job: Locksmith: 12) and quite deft (Deft +). His deftness gives him a bonus of 1 for the job, so he’s at 13. The GM decides that this lock is easy to pick (difficulty 9). Harraks player rolls a 3. 3 is uneven, so it’s substracted and Harrak reaches a 10 (13 minus 3). So he accomplishes this task with a difference of 1 and the lock clicks open.*
### Contest
If two characters compete, both roll as for a test. The one with the higher result wins. The difference between the results shows his margin of success.  
*Example: Darius and Hildy enter a drinking contest. Darius rolls on Stays Sharp (12) with a bonus from Burned Past (+) and Experienced (+). Hildy uses Seasoned Sailor (12) with a bonus from Swearing, Spitting Gal (+). Hildy rolls a 4 and reaches 12 + 1 + 4 = 17. Darius rolls a 1 and gets 12 + 2 - 1 = 13. So Hildy wins with a difference of 4 and still oders pint for pint hours after Darius started hugging the ground.*
###  Battle
For Fighting, Charakters have weapons, armor and a wound threshold. In close combat both participants roll on a suitable value (a contest). The one with the higher result hits his enemy. On a draw the attacker hits. In ranged combat only the attacker rolls (task: difficulty given by the weapon or 12 up to 5m, 15 up to 50m, +3 for complications, -3 in a relaxed situation). If he succeeds, he hits.  
The struck charakter takes an amount of damage equal to the difference of the results plus the winners weapon minus his armor. If the damage reaches his wound threshold, he takes a wound which gives him a malus of 3 on all rolls until it’s healed. A hit with a damage of 3x wound threshold means sudden incapacitation.  
The normal wound threshold is between 3 and 6, weapon damage and armor between 1 (dagger / dart / cloth) und 8 (axe / rifle / plate). If one of the fighters only wants to defend, he gets a bonus of 6 but causes no damage if he hits.  
For healing the player rolls once per week with a ±D6. Then he adds 1 per + in suitable attributes. If the result is at least 0, one wound heals. Strain, missing care or nursing give between -3 and +3.  
*Example: Daenes (Fists 15, confident +, strong +) tries to put down a rogue Rakasha (Claws 12). Daenes player rolls a 4 and reaches 21 (15 plus 2 plus 4). The Game Master rolls a 4, so she gets 16 (12 plus 4). So Daenes hits her enemy with a difference of 5 points (21 minus 16) and does 6 damage (1 from her fire reaml hardened knuckles). The damage reaches the wound threshold of the Rakasha (5) and wounds her. Till that wound heals, the Rakasha has a malus of 3 on all rolls. She tries to escape and decides to just defend. That gives her a bonus of 6. Together with the wound she now has 15 (12-3+6). Daenes attacks again and rolls a 3, reaching 14 (15 plus 2 minus 3). The GM rolls a 1 and also reaches 14 (15 minus 1). Since Daenes attacks, she hits. But she does not cause a wound. Nevertheless the Rakasha gets hit again and surrenders. She is bound and her wounds are treated. A week later she rolls for healing. The die shows a 1, which is -1, but the nursing from other prisoners gives her a bonus of 1. That suffices to reach 0 and her wound heals.*
##  Pirate-Party
Being a Pirate is Great!
Especially when you’re a treasure hunter!
And transport friends as passangers!
And one of them can cure your hangover with a snap of her fingers!
Except if something goes wrong…
