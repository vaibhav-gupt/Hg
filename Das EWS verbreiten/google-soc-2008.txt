About Your Organization     ^ back to top

   1. What is your Organization's Name?

1d6 roleplaying

   2. What is your Organization's Homepage?

http://1w6.org

   3. Describe your organization.

1d6 roleplaying is a community of roleplayers who are designing a flexible and balanced role-playing-system which is the only free pen-and-paper rpg under copyleft licenses. 

In development since 2003, it features a slim base system (ruleset) which was built to be built upon, and since the beginning of 2007 we use this base system to create free roleplaying utilities. 

We work in python, because it is flexible, cross platform available and a joy to use, and we create the system under free licenses, because we believe that roleplaying not only makes the world more fun, but also makes it a better place, and the system people use creates the physics of their world, while they are playing, and these physics should be as free as the software they use. 

   4. Why is your organization applying to participate in GSoC 2008? What do you hope to gain by participating?

We hope to find more members for our programming team, who want to use the created groundwork and the balanced ruleset in creative and fun ways. 

Also we hope to find people who help to use the already developed tools to create a general game-engine using Python and pyglet which facilitates game development by offering the 1d6 ruleset as base for game designers.

About The Program

   1. What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students?

We will make sure, that even an unfinished contribution will help the project by working with a clear roadmap with major milestones. 

If a student disappears, we can not reach him/her, but we can take steps to minimize the chance that the student disappears in the first place. 

For this, the student must report to the community on a weekly base, so he/she directly experiences the feedback. 

Also the student must write well commented code, so even unfinished code can be completed by other members. Automatic testing will be done using the tools from Ohloh, backed by manual overview by the existing members of our project. 

   2. What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors?

We have backup mentors, and the mentors know, that their reputation is at stake. 

Mentors must regularly report to the community, too, so that their work can be carried on easily. 

   3. What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your project's community before, during and after the program?

As for reducing the chance for disappearance, we want them to report to the community on a weekly basis, so they directly experience the feedback and fun free software development brings with it. 

   4. What will you do to ensure that your accepted students stick with the project after GSoC concludes?

We will include them as full members in our planning, so that they can take an active role in the future of our project, so that they can feel a sense of ownership about the parts they contribute themselves.
